# Lottery Numbers Generator

Lottery Numbers Generator is an SPA that is written in javascript and uses React as the web framework using hooks and state. The app allows users to select from a choice of lottery games, such as EuroMillions, Lotto and Thunderball and proceeds to generate random lottery numbers for the selected game, including any extra or bonus balls required.

This responsive project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The application is currently work in progress, but will hopefully soon be hosted on netlify.
